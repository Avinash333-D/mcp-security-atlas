# Security Scope & Safety Guardrails

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Scope Enforcement
Before executing any tool (Nmap, ZAP, Burp, Chrome), you MUST verify the target against the `active_scope.txt` file.

## 🚫 Restricted Domains (DO NOT SCAN)
You are strictly prohibited from interacting with or scanning the following:
- Any domain ending in `.gov`, `.mil`, `.edu`, or `.int`.
- Infrastructure providers: `*.amazonaws.com` (unless explicitly in scope), `*.azure.com`, `*.google.com`.
- Any IP address in the private ranges: `10.0.0.0/8`, `172.16.0.0/12`, `192.168.0.0/16`.
- Your own local machine (`localhost`, `127.0.0.1`) unless testing a specific local lab.

## 🛠️ Tool Execution Rules
1. **Rate Limiting:** Do not exceed 5 requests per second in the Browser MCP or ZAP.
2. **Identification:** Always set a custom User-Agent in Browser/ZAP: `Roo-Automated-Security-Researcher-Project`.
3. **Validation:** If you find a URL in the browser that is NOT in your `active_scope.txt`, you must ABORT the attack phase for that specific URL.

# Rule: Financial Priority
- Before starting a scan, Roo must confirm the presence of a "Bounty Table" on the program page.
- IF "Bounty Table" is missing AND "Safe Harbor" is present, categorize as VDP.
- DO NOT execute Nmap or ZAP on VDP targets unless the user provides the override command: "Proceed with VDP".
- Logic: Paid BBP > Points VDP.

## 📧 Reporting Guardrails
- Never send raw logs via email; always summarize into the Professional Report format.
- Ensure the Gmail MCP only sends to the verified address: [YOUR_EMAIL@GMAIL.COM].
